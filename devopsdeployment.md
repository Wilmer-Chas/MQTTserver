Devops technologies
Vi använder:
bash
python
git och GitOps (via GitLab CI)
terraform
ansible
kubernetes
ArgoCD
Docker Swarm
Portainer
helm
caddy
...


Terraform	Provision cloud infrastructure (VMs, Kubernetes clusters, managed DBs, public IPs, DNS records). Helps create public endpoints and private networks.
Kubernetes	Run your backend, MQTT broker, and frontend in containers with controlled networking. Supports exposing services publicly with internal security.
Helm	Package and deploy your apps to Kubernetes with configurable settings (e.g., expose MQTT or backend via Ingress).
ArgoCD	GitOps tool to continuously deploy and update your services securely and reliably in the cloud.
Caddy	Reverse proxy / Ingress controller to expose backend, MQTT, and frontend securely with automatic TLS (HTTPS). Handles global accessibility securely.
Docker (Compose or Swarm)	Useful for local dev environment orchestration and simulating the full stack locally.
GitLab CI (GitOps)	Automates building, testing, and deploying code and infrastructure changes. Ensures consistent and secure deployments from source control.

Locally:
Docker Compose/Swarm orchestrates backend, MQTT broker, frontend.
Services run on localhost/private network.
Use scripts for quick start/stop and testing.

Cloud/Production:
Terraform provisions Kubernetes cluster + DB + DNS + networking.
Kubernetes (with Helm charts) deploys your containers.
Caddy exposes frontend/backend/MQTT via public HTTPS URLs.
Backend talks privately to DB inside cluster or private network.
MQTT broker exposed securely with authentication and TLS.
ArgoCD continuously syncs deployments from Git repos.




Step 1: Understand Your Application Architecture

Goal: Know how your pieces talk to each other and what needs to be exposed or kept private.

    Arduino connects to MQTT Broker (public)

    Backend connects to MQTT Broker (public) and Database (private)

    Frontend talks to Backend (public)

    Frontend is accessible to anyone (public)

Action: Draw a simple diagram showing these components and their connections.
Step 2: Run Your Services Locally with Docker Compose

Goal: Simulate the whole stack on your local machine so you can develop and test without worrying about the cloud yet.

    Create a docker-compose.yml with:

        MQTT broker (e.g., Eclipse Mosquitto)

        Backend container

        Frontend container or dev server

        Database container (e.g., PostgreSQL)

Why:
You get isolated environments, consistent dependencies, and easy startup/shutdown with one command.
Step 3: Expose Services Securely for Local Testing

Goal: Make your local backend and MQTT broker reachable for testing Arduino or frontend against real endpoints.

    Use ngrok or localtunnel to create a secure tunnel from the internet to your local MQTT or backend.

    This simulates public URLs without deploying to the cloud.

Step 4: Set Up Version Control and CI/CD Basics

Goal: Track your code and configs; automate building and testing.

    Put your backend, frontend, and Docker Compose files in Git.

    Use GitLab CI (or GitHub Actions) to build Docker images automatically on commit.

    (Optional for now) Run basic tests.

Step 5: Provision Simple Cloud Infrastructure with Terraform

Goal: Get comfortable creating infrastructure as code.

    Start small:

        Create a Kubernetes cluster (or a managed Kubernetes service).

        Provision a private database instance.

        Create DNS records for your MQTT broker, backend, and frontend.

Tip: Focus on one resource at a time.
Step 6: Deploy Your Services to Kubernetes Using Helm

Goal: Learn to package and deploy your apps declaratively.

    Create simple Helm charts for MQTT broker, backend, and frontend.

    Deploy them to your Kubernetes cluster.

    Expose backend and MQTT broker with Ingress (use Caddy or NGINX Ingress Controller).

Step 7: Use ArgoCD for Continuous Deployment

Goal: Automate deployments by syncing your Git repos to your cluster.

    Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster.

    Configure it to watch your Helm charts repository.

    Make changes in Git → ArgoCD applies those changes automatically.

Step 8: Secure Your Services

Goal: Use TLS and authentication to keep everything safe.

    Configure Caddy or your Ingress controller for HTTPS with automatic TLS (Let’s Encrypt).

    Set up MQTT authentication (usernames/passwords, certs).

    Restrict backend’s database access to only the backend pods.

Step 9: Monitor and Iterate

Goal: Learn to detect and fix issues proactively.

    Add simple logging (backend logs, MQTT logs).

    Use monitoring tools like Prometheus + Grafana (optional at start).

    Improve automation and security over time.

Why This Roadmap Helps

    You start locally and get your code and services working before adding complexity.

    You introduce one new tool or concept at a time so you don’t get overwhelmed.

    You gradually move from manual to automated deployments.

    You build confidence by tackling small, concrete goals instead of the whole system at once.
