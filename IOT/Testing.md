This document provides an overview of the testing approach, tools, and coverage used in the project, with a focus on hardware-software integration (e.g., Arduino-based systems).

## 1. Testing Strategy

Given the nature of the project â€” which combined embedded hardware (e.g., Arduinos) with software components â€” testing was primarily manual and conducted using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approach.

Our testing followed a bottom-up, hardware-first strategy, consisting of the following phases:

### ðŸ”§ Isolated Sensor Testing

Each sensor was first tested independently in a controlled environment, typically using a breadboard and minimal supporting code.  
This phase focused on confirming basic hardware functionality, such as:

- Correct sensor readings  
- Response to physical inputs  
- Stable power and signal behavior  

Testing at this stage helped eliminate hardware-specific issues before integrating with the broader system.

### ðŸ§ª Code Prototyping

Once the sensor's functionality was verified, corresponding software was developed to interface with it. This involved:

- Reading data over serial or analog inputs  
- Applying any necessary calibration or logic  
- Triggering outputs (e.g., actuators or LEDs)  

The code was tested in short iterative cycles, often using tools like the Serial Monitor to observe real-time behavior.

### ðŸ”— Incremental System Integration

When both the hardware and software components were considered stable, they were integrated into the larger system (e.g., the central Arduino controller).  
After each integration step, manual validation was conducted to ensure:

- No conflicts with existing modules  
- Stable overall system behavior  
- Correct communication between components  
- Review and testing of the integrated code to ensure it worked reliably within the full system context, as this was a critical focus of validation  

### âœ… Final Validation

As a final step, all modules were tested together in the full system setup. A designated person performed system-level validation to ensure:

- All sensors functioned correctly when combined  
- No regressions or unexpected interactions occurred  
- The full system met expected behavior standards

## 4. Limitations

- No unit testing frameworks are used due to Arduino constraints.  
- Testing is **not automated**; requires manual validation on physical hardware.  
- Timing-related behaviors (e.g., delays, sensor intervals) are tested by observation.

## 5. Future Improvements

- Explore use of [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [ArduinoUnit](https://github.com/mmurdoch/arduinounit) for partial test automation.  

  **PlatformIO**  
  PlatformIO is an advanced development ecosystem that supports embedded programming across many platforms, including Arduino. It provides:  
  - Built-in unit testing framework: Enables writing and running automated unit tests on code modules that do not require hardware interaction or can be simulated.  
  - Hardware-in-the-loop support: Allows running tests on actual hardware or hardware simulators.  
  - Integration with Continuous Integration (CI): Automated builds and tests can be integrated into CI pipelines, ensuring code quality with every commit.  
  - Enhanced build and debugging tools: Streamlines the development workflow, reducing manual steps.  

  **ArduinoUnit**  
  ArduinoUnit is a simple unit testing framework designed specifically for Arduino sketches. It allows:  
  - Writing small, focused unit tests directly inside Arduino code.  
  - Running these tests on the actual Arduino hardware.  
  - Reporting results over serial communication for easy monitoring.  

- Implement better logging and test methodology for hardware tests.
