# üìò Project Retrospective Report

## 1. Project Overview
- **7-11 Bygg:**  
- **3 months:**  
- **Fabian √Öman, Wilmer Forsman, Viktor Kvick, Sandra Obradovic and Nikki Norman:**  
- **Goal: Creating a hardware project that communicates with a backend, frontend.**  
- **Deliverable: A system that can monitor health of an individual and the surrounding environment**

## 2. What Went Well
### ‚úÖ Successes
- *Effective Collaboration:* [There has been clear communication between the teams and a willingness to help.]
-*Managed network communication between backend and IOT* [The network communication between backend and IOT side in the end would be well managed and stable]
- *Working Prototype:* [At one point during the project our prototype worked]


### üìå Highlights
- **
- *Positive Feedback:* [Victor Axelsson (CTO and CO-founder at Kliently) claimed that he saw some real potential in our product, that it might be worth developing further.]

## 3. What Didn‚Äôt Go Well
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges or Issues
- *Connection issues with connectors* A lack of knowledge concerning electricity within the group is apparent, where none in the group could anticipate issues when it came to short-circuiting. 

- *Delayed delivery of sensors:* Issues such as scope creep, delayed approvals, and disruptions caused setbacks in receiving and integrating hardware components.



### üìâ Areas for Improvement
- Next time we could be more careful not to break any hardware component like what we did to the GPS sensor. Mostly by reading more about electricity

- More access to the backend's database to more accurately be able to debug issues relevant to server communication between backend and IOT. Where right now we basically need to ask the backend for help when fixing these issues, which is inefficient.

- Due to the relatively short span of the project it was difficult to organize more meetings with the other teams. We would have liked to work more closely with them to exchange even more knowledge and streamline processes.

## 4. Lessons Learned
### üí° Insights Gained
- *Use transistors more when working with electricity:* 
- *Server Communication*
- *Functional Programming management* 
-*Javascript, nodeJS*
-*Better at reading others code, figuring out how to decipher what it does*
-*Learned the basics of a frontend developers workflow and code structure*




### üó£ Team Reflections
-*B√§sta devops som inte har devops*



## 5. Closing Notes
### üéâ Final Thoughts
- [In short it has been a fun project and we have learned a lot. Through ups and downs we are happy with the end product despite the time and resource limitations. The team has worked hard and we are proud of our achievement.]
